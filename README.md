# An Analysis of Sex Differences in Computing Teaching Evaluations

This repository is associated with the paper _An Analysis of Sex Differences in Computing Teaching Evaluations_, which will be published in the proceedings of the third workshop on Gender Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion in Software Engineering (GE@ICSE, 2022).

### Paper Abstract

Anonymous student teacher evaluations are commonly used to
evaluate the quality of computing instructors at the university level.
However, such teaching evaluations are subject to gender and sexbased biases, calling into question their utility and scope. In this
paper, we first use data from a large public American university
to replicate previous findings showing that significant sex-related
differences persist in computing teaching evaluations. Intriguingly,
we find that the sex-differences in computing teaching evaluations
are primarily driven by bias involving professors, while significant sex-based differences for student-instructors are not observed.
Finally, we place the magnitude of the sex-based differences we
observe into a broader engineering context.
