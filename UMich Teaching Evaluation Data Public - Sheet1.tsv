Teaching evaluation data aggregated by department and broken down by sex, instructor type, and question Note: Only contains data from classes with enrollment of at least 40 (top quartile of class size)  If you are interested in viewing data for individual instructors or for individual courses, please reach out to Madeline Endres (endremad@umich.edu) and Westley Weimer (weimerw@umich.edu)												
Department of the data for any given row. See Sheet 2 for decoding these	Instructor Type: Professor, Not a Professer (e.g., TA), or All (Professor and Not a Professor) 	The sex of instructors in this row	The teaching evaluation question (or questions) considered in this row	The number of instructors aggregated in this row	Number of "Strong Disagree" ratings 	Number of "Disagree" ratings 	Number of "Neutral" ratings 	Number of "Agree" ratings 	Number of "Strong Agree" ratings 	Number of "Not Applicable" ratings 	Total number of ratings (not including NA ratings)	Average evaluation score for teachers aggregated in this row.  Note: Calculated by first calculating the score for each teacher using an Interpolated Median (http://aec.umich.edu/median.php). These scores are then averaged. Thus, this column will not equal the Interpolated Median of the raw data in columns SD-SA)
